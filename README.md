## Description
The SPI module allows a duplex, synchronous, serial communication between the MCU and peripheral
devices. It is used for short distance and single master communication. Transmissions normally involve two shift registers of some given word size, one in the master and one in
the slave; they are connected in a ring. SPI interface defines only the communication lines and the clock edge.
